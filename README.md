# hydrogenaudio-elkarte-theme
A collection of my changes to the default ElkArte theme, designed for use by the Hydrogen Audio forums.

This collection of changes is my attempt to bring the ElkArte community forum up to speed with what most current
Hydrogen Audio forums users have come to expect their community to look like. I have tried to port over various
colors, and some styles as well. Of course, due to copyright reasons, I cannot port the original over verbatim,
since the original was mostly derived from the original Invision Power Board 2.x default theme.

That is not to say that I have done a perfect job so far. Not in the least. But this is where you, the loyal
user base, come in. Any user is welcome to register a Github account, fork this repository, and make changes to
the theme. There is no guarantee I will accept them, but I will definitely review them, and consider them for
inclusion in the up to date product. It will be an ongoing effort, though.

Not every theme change will please everyone, so it may be worth suggesting where alternate copies of the theme
files may be installed, so users will have some manner of choice of what their forums will look like every day.

Fork and pull, everyone!
